## Causal Inference Using Directional and Unidirectional Enrichment Analysis on Biological Networks

Identification of active regulatory pathways under specific molecular and environmental perturbations is crucial for understanding cellular function. However, inferring causal regulatory mechanisms directly from differential gene expression data is very difficult and remains a central challenge in computational biology.  We present CIE, an early version of a user-friendly web-app, and a tool box which facilitate inference of casual regulatory mechanisms based on existing knowledge bases of regulator-target interactions and user-provided differential gene expression data.
