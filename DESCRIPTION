Description: This package allows for idenfiication of causual regulators responsible for gene expression differences observed through RNA-seq.  The user provides differential gene expression data and selects a database.  Enrichment is then performed to identify the key regulators.  We also support pathway enrichment on these regulators through Reactome and visualization of these regulators.
